# Clash-With-Class-Advanced

This project is an extension of a project developed while working on the final project in the lecture series [C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/cpp-fundamentals). After completing this project initially I created a to-do list of features I wanted to challenge myself in implementing.
Additionally, as I progressed in my studies at formal education institutions, I tried to implement topics that I learned from those programs as well.

This program makes use of the [Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/) which packages a number of core libraries that support graphics, audio tools, and vector mathematics into a single source.
