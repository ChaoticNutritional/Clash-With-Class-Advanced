# Clash-With-Class-Advanced

This project is an extension of a project developed while working on the final project in the lecture series [C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/cpp-fundamentals). After completing this project initially I created a to-do list of features I wanted to challenge myself in implementing.
Additionally, as I progressed in my studies at formal education institutions, I tried to implement topics that I learned from those programs as well.

This program makes use of the [Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/) which packages a number of core libraries that support graphics, audio tools, and vector mathematics into a single source.

## TODO

- Invincible time & color flash
  - I was in the process of working out a way to set the player status to invincible and flash white when taking damage

- Enemy variants
  - I want to add additional variants of enemies without the addition of new art assets. I'd like to indicate color representing enemy challenge rating (health total)

- Change enemy damage behavior (P1)
  - Currently enemies produce continuous damage when contact is made with the player. When finished with current changes enemy behavior should produce the following: (Please excuse nebulous language)
    - Enemies will reach acceptable follow radius distance
    - Perform charge animation. Towards the end of charge time, enemy will store a reference to the player's position in world space
    - Will dash at faster speed towards locked location of player
    - Return to chase after brief pause
